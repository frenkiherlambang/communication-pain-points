# Dashboard Authentication Protection

## Overview
All dashboard routes (`/dashboard/*`) are now protected and require user authentication. Unauthenticated users will be automatically redirected to the login page.

## Implementation

### 1. Middleware Protection (Server-Side)
**File:** `middleware.ts`

The middleware intercepts all requests to `/dashboard/*` routes and:
- Checks if the user has a valid Supabase session
- Redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` with a redirect parameter
- Allows authenticated users to proceed
- Also prevents authenticated users from accessing `/login` or `/register` pages

**How it works:**
- Uses Supabase SSR client to check authentication status
- Runs on every request to protected routes
- Manages cookies for session persistence

### 2. Client-Side Authentication Utilities
**File:** `lib/auth-client.ts`

Provides helper functions for client-side authentication:
- `createClient()` - Creates a Supabase browser client
- `getSession()` - Gets the current user session
- `getUser()` - Gets the current authenticated user
- `signOut()` - Signs out the current user

### 3. Dashboard Layout Protection (Client-Side)
**File:** `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`

The dashboard layout:
- Checks authentication on mount
- Shows a loading spinner while checking auth status
- Redirects to login if user is not authenticated
- Subscribes to auth state changes
- Automatically redirects if user logs out
- Displays user information (email, avatar) from authenticated session

**Features:**
- Real-time authentication state monitoring
- Graceful handling of logout
- User profile display from session data
- Loading states for better UX

### 4. Updated Login API Route
**File:** `app/api/api/login/route.ts`

The login endpoint now:
- Uses Supabase SSR client for proper cookie management
- Sets authentication cookies on successful login
- Maintains session across requests

## Protected Routes
All routes under `/dashboard` are protected:
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard page
- `/dashboard/topics` - Topics page
- `/dashboard/customer-feedbacks` - Customer feedbacks inbox
- Any future dashboard sub-routes

## Authentication Flow

### Login Flow:
1. User visits `/login`
2. User enters credentials
3. Login API sets Supabase auth cookies
4. User is redirected to `/dashboard`
5. Middleware validates session
6. Dashboard layout confirms authentication
7. User sees dashboard content

### Protected Route Access:
1. User tries to access `/dashboard/*`
2. Middleware checks for valid session
3. **If authenticated:** User proceeds to dashboard
4. **If not authenticated:** User redirected to `/login?redirect=/dashboard/[route]`

### Logout Flow:
1. User clicks logout button
2. `signOut()` is called
3. Supabase clears session and cookies
4. Auth state change listener detects logout
5. User is redirected to `/login`

## Key Dependencies
- `@supabase/ssr` - Server-side authentication with cookie management
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Supabase client library

## Environment Variables Required
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous key

## Usage Example

### Accessing User Data in Protected Routes:
```typescript
import { getUser } from '@/lib/auth-client'

const user = await getUser()
console.log(user.email) // Authenticated user's email
```

### Manual Logout:
```typescript
import { signOut } from '@/lib/auth-client'

await signOut()
// User will be automatically redirected to login
```

## Testing
To test the authentication:

1. **Test unauthenticated access:**
   - Navigate to `/dashboard` without logging in
   - Should redirect to `/login?redirect=/dashboard`

2. **Test authenticated access:**
   - Login at `/login`
   - Should redirect to `/dashboard`
   - Try accessing `/dashboard/topics` - should work

3. **Test logout:**
   - Click logout in dashboard
   - Should redirect to `/login`
   - Try accessing `/dashboard` - should redirect to login

4. **Test session persistence:**
   - Login at `/login`
   - Refresh the page
   - Should remain logged in

## Security Notes
- All authentication checks happen both on the server (middleware) and client (layout)
- Session is stored in HTTP-only cookies (managed by Supabase)
- Middleware runs before page rendering, providing server-side protection
- Client-side checks provide additional security and UX improvements
