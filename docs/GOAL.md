SIRENE (System for Intelligence Research & Engagement Analytics) is our platform for monitoring how customers interact with our products. Our priority is to identify pain points in customer communications, from pre-purchase inquiries to after-sales support, so we can resolve frustrations, strengthen trust, and improve brand perception.



SIRENE RESEARCH FOCUS:

1. Pain Point Detection:
   - Frustrations in customer service (delays, unclear answers, robotic responses)
   - Confusion in product information or messaging (specs, availability, pricing clarity)
   - Lack of personalization or empathy in interactions
   - Gaps between customer expectation vs. received response

2. Potential Crisis Triggers:
   - Spikes in negative sentiment tied to service failures or unclear communications
   - Viral complaints that highlight systemic issues

3. Opportunity Identification:
   - Recurring questions that suggest FAQ/content improvements
   - User feedback that points to campaign messaging clarity needs
   - Channels with unmet demand for faster/more tailored responses

4. Actionable Outputs:
   - Content plan inputs based on frequently misunderstood topics
   - Campaign brief insights from customer frustrations
   - Recommendations for tone, speed, and platform usage in communications
